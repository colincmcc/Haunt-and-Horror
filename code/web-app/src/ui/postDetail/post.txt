<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Beyond The Gates (2016)&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“In the wake of their father’s mysterious disappearance, two estranged brothers — responsible Gordon and reckless John — reunite to sift through the contents of his stubbornly anachronistic VHS rental store. Among the inventory, they discover an interactive VCR board game, which their father viewed<span class="yZlgBd">&nbsp;just before he vanished. Intrigued, the boys pop in the tape, press play, and soon discover that, far from an ordinary game, the video is a portal to a nightmarish alternate reality.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">One of my personal indie favorites, <strong>Beyond the Gates</strong> is a great original fright for those of you looking for an up-and-coming horror artist with a talent for new films with a nostalgic feel and classic special effects. From a – frankly – FUN storyline to relatable characters, this movie truly hits the spot for us creepy fans that are looking for an almost 80s <strong>Videodrome</strong> feel. So turn out the lights and dive into this otherworldly feature and remember,”&nbsp;After all, there is nothing real outside our perception of reality, is there?”</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Creep (2014)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Aaron answers an online ad and drives to a stranger’s house to film him for the day. The man wants to make a movie for his unborn child, but his requests become more bizarre as the day goes along.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In the age of technology, we’ve been lucky enough to have creative folks out there that brought about the found-footage horror film genre leading to movies such as <strong>Paranormal Activity</strong> (face it, the first one was a hell of a good time) and <strong>V/H/S</strong> and <strong>Creep</strong> is a fantastic example of how someone with an eerie and creative idea doesn’t need hollywood $$$ to put out an awesome low-budget movie. Preying on our natural fear of putting our trust and even safety in the hands of a complete stranger, this film will keep you uncomfortable and anxious in the best possible way.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House (2016)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Hired to care for a reclusive elderly author (Paula Prentiss), a live-in nurse (Ruth Wilson) comes to believe her house is haunted.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">A Netflix Original,<span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size: 1.0625rem;">is an almost mirage-like slow creeping film with a fabulous use of sound (and lack thereof) and poetic language and narration. This is certainly a great horror movie for anyone looking to watch something ominous and quiet with a truly surprising twist, I would highly recommend throwing on during a quiet, rainy evening in a very dark room.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-141" src="https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Void-01-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" srcset="https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Void-01-203x300.jpg 203w, https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Void-01-768x1137.jpg 768w, https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Void-01-691x1024.jpg 691w" sizes="(max-width: 203px) 100vw, 203px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Void (2016)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Cloaked, cult-like figures trap a police officer (Aaron Poole), patients and staffers inside a hospital that is a gateway to evil.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Reminiscent of dark and obscure sci-fi movies like <strong>Event Horizon</strong> and countless others, <strong>The Void</strong> explores and pushes the limits on life and death in this macabre Lovecraftian-esque tale following&nbsp;a small group of strangers tied to a seemingly inescapable and&nbsp;apocalyptic fate. Cults, hell-like monsters, hostages – what more do you want from a horror movie??</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-145" src="https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MV5BMjAzMzAyMDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwOTY2NDM@._V1_-202x300.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="300" srcset="https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MV5BMjAzMzAyMDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwOTY2NDM@._V1_-202x300.jpg 202w, https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MV5BMjAzMzAyMDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwOTY2NDM@._V1_-768x1140.jpg 768w, https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MV5BMjAzMzAyMDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwOTY2NDM@._V1_-690x1024.jpg 690w, https://hauntandhorror.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MV5BMjAzMzAyMDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwOTY2NDM@._V1_.jpg 1380w" sizes="(max-width: 202px) 100vw, 202px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Ritual (2017)</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">“Reuniting after the tragic death of their friend, four college pals set out to hike through the Scandinavian wilderness. A wrong turn leads them into the mysterious forests of Norse legend, where an ancient evil exists and stalks them at every turn.”</p>
<p>It would seems no one heeds the phrase “Stay Out of the Forest” (I’m looking at you <a href="https://www.myfavoritemurder.com/spring-tour">murderinos</a>!) and this is why we can’t have nice things,&nbsp;<strong>The Ritual</strong>&nbsp;is a perfect example of just that. This feature taps into a very old and stylized evil lurking in the shadows of both reality and our deepest, darkest thoughts as our main characters, in an attempt to bond and honor a fallen friend, trek through the wild and mysterious woods all the while feeling as though they are being stalked by something sinister. While watching this movie, i’m reminded of something my brother told me a long time ago while trying to set my childlike fears at ease: “Don’t be afraid of the dark…just be afraid of what’s lurking in it”.</p>
